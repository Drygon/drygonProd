    <h4>What is DRYGON ?? </h4>
    <p>
      This limerick was written by my son when he was seven years old.  He created the original
      {" "}
      <em> Drygon </em>
      {" "}
      creature.  I designed the mature Drygon which is incorporated in the company logo combining a powerful dragon with the mythical phoenix.
